## Experimentation Process

My experimentation process consisted in first, I tried between the sequential and API models, the API came out as with the best results, I was able to see that adding one more hidden layer improved the accuracy but decreased when 2 more layers were added in sequential model, adding more neurons in the hidden layers improved the accuracy, a bigger filter size in the first convolutional layer decreased the accuracy, a bigger pooling size in the first pooling layer decreased the accuracy, increasing the number of filters increased the accuracy, reducing the dropout also improved the accuracy, so even though in some specific cases the sequential model shown better results, overall the API model was the best for this type of classification problem.
